    "The answer is - `[1,2,3,4,5]`. `x` is a mutable type in Python and function calls do not create a hard-copy of the object, rather only the soft copy. This means we get a \"pointer\" to `x`, which means any modifications to `list_` in `add` is permanent. Note: unlike other languages, there is no way to mark an argument to a function as read-only (although in C++ for example, that isn't a security enforcement therefore it can be bypassed by sufficiently determined)\n",

    "However, list manipulation can be expensive - especially if the list grows sufficiently long enough. One of the most dangerous aspects of this is hard-copy, where we create a new list containing every element from the source list. The most notable use-case of this is dynamic programming where we may wish to simulate adding a different element (or in different order) to a particular list.\n",
