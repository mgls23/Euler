# Project Euler
My own implementation of Project Euler [https://projecteuler.net/archives], a set of mathematical computational challenges.

If Google has somehow redirected you to my repository, I'm going to repeat the disclaimer on the website - try the challenges for yourself. I publish my solutions to give a sense of what my Python coding looks like. It doesn't always include explanations.  

## Try these Questions again!
### Looked at solutions
  * 78
  * 92

### Deeper Research
  * Euclidean formula (9, 39)
  * 

## Requirements
To run this project, you'll need the latest version of Python. Currently, this is Python 3.9 or above
### Python 3.9
  * functools.cache
  * functools.lru_cache
### Python 3.8
  * math.prod

## Technical Debt
I used Project Euler to get better at programming, and this includes my early days of programming.
There are a lot of legacy + ugly code  I haven't got around to fixing.

Importing from Jupyter Notebook allows me to document my solutions. Each solutions really should be implemented into its own jupyter notebook.
